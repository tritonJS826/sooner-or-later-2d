***SOONER-OR-LATER***
=====================

Overview
--------

* Development of a tool in the form of a game for collaborative interactive learning. The game initially contains content for training, which is laid by the developers. The content is not limited only to the one that was originally in the system. It is a framework that allows to choose the content you want to explore on your own.Anything that can be displayed in a "question-answer" format can be used as content. The effectiveness in the game depends on the skills from real life.

* Main study method: spaced repetition.
---

Potential consumers
------------------
* Evereyone who whant to learn something
* Everyone who want to teach someone else
---

Technologies
------------
* We love javascript because most team members understand it and can support services written in it, but in general we are open to any languages ​​and approaches that can be effective.
* MainStack:
    * FS: React, typescript, mobX
    * GWSS: node, typescript, socket.io
    * LWSS: node, typescript, webSockets
    * SDS: node, typescript, GraphQL    
Git
---
* In the default branch, we do not fill in anything and do not merge without approval.
* You don't need to formalize PR, but try to think it over, maybe an extra couple of comments will not hurt.
* We prefer a linear commit history, so we try to use something like rebase locally before uploading to the server.
* You should not make many commits in one PR if there is no need for it.
* One task - preferably one commit (if the task is large, then there may be a couple). One commit - one task.
* Branch naming:  *[feat/fix/docs/refactor]/[issue number]/description-with-few-worlds*
* Commits naming: "#24 issue title [comment]" of if issue is absent: "[Docs/Front/Back/WSS]: description"


Policy
------
* Because this is an open source framework, it would be good not to neglect the documentation, but since Maintaining up-to-date documentation costs a lot of time, and irrelevant docs are worse than their absence, then perhaps it is not worth documenting everything, everything. We prefer to use documentation in the code for developers and high-level descriptions of services in files like READMEs. For now, we keep the documentation for users in a short form in the CONSUMER_ABOUT.md file, if necessary or to indicate any important things.
* We try to design the code as much as possible in the style in which other developers worked.
* We discuss all issues and despite the fact that we want to make the development process sustainable, we are open to any suggestions and are ready to apply new changes if they are effective.
* We are happy to try new approaches and technologies, and experiment.
* We love criticism in any direction, especially about processes and code.

Out of scope
------------
* We do not plan to make money on this project yet (but we are ready to consider specific options)
* We do not compete with anyone for the market (but we can analyze it and learn from experience)
