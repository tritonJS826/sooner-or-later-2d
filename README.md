SOONER OR LATER project)

***Main issues for prototype***:
    * add style modules instead css  
    * add good styles & images/gifs  
    * targetInfoBlock component  
    * create text component  
    * storyBlock/storyInterface  
    * victory condition  
    * we need to create unique id's for cards instead cards id from json. It will allow to create similar cards at the same time  
    * create input component  
    * realization of logic when hero died
    * add vim navigation in menu
    * onClickOnEnemy (for mobiles instead ctrl)
    * back to menu button

***Big problems***:
